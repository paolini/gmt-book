How to get your changes into the project
----------------------------------------

(1) Easiest and quickest way: Simply edit any of the LaTeX files and email the
new version.

(2) It is sometimes convenient to send only the difference between the new
version and the old one. Please use "diff -u" in this case to produce the
patch. It will help if you follow the suggestions below, or do something with
equivalent endproduct. To create a patch for a single file, say stacks.tex,
you can do the following. First download stacks.tex. Make a copy:

	cp stacks.tex stacks.tex.orig

and then edit stacks.tex as you like. (Or, if you've already edited the file,
you download and save the version from the web directly as stacks.tex.orig.) To
make the patch use

	diff -u stacks.tex.orig stacks.tex > stacks.tex.patch

Email the patchfile. Please include PATCH in the subject line.

(3) Nontrivial method: Create a patch for the whole project,
especially useful if you are editing multiple files. To do this you can use the
following steps.
	(3a) Install git, see https://git-scm.com
	(3b) Clone the project. Type
		git clone git://github.com/stacks/stacks-project.git
	(3c) Change into the stacks directory. Run make, edit files, etc.
	(3d) Produce patch by running
		git diff > patchfile.patch
	(3e) Email the patchfile.
This works as long as you do not use any git commands in step (3c).

(4) Technologically advanced method: If you want to use more of the features
of git, see the file git-howto.
